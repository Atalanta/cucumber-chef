I was not particularly happy with the state of the 2.x documents and considering workflow changes, etc it made sense to me to start over with the documentation.  Since most things are the same the 2.x documentation will remain available in the repo as `WIKI.2.x.md`.  This is WIP.

# Cucumber-Chef 3.x Documentation

Cucumber-chef is a library of tools to enable the emerging discipline of infrastructure as code to practice test driven development.  It provides a testing platform within which Cucumber tests can be run which provision virtual machines, configure them by applying the appropriate Chef roles to them, and then run acceptance and integration tests against the environment.

# Prerequsites/Recommendations

Your `chef-repo` should be setup in a manner as follows:

* Use something like RVM for your ruby with your chef-repo
* Use something like bundler for your rubygems with your chef-repo
* Use something like berkshelf for your chef cookbooks with your chef-repo

If you do not use these patterns you will have an unpleasant time in general.

# Workflow

When doing integration testing it makes sense that one generally wants to test across an entire ecosystem of servers.  You typically acquire a set of virtual or bare metal servers, provision those servers acordingly, put them into play then rinse and repeat.  I introduce the `Labfile`, the concept is simple if you haven't already guessed it.  You define a set of servers, i.e. an ecosystem, also dictating the settings and configuration.  Part of this change is because a) it makes alot of sense to me and b) it greatly decreases runtimes.  Also in cucumber-chef 2.x, we had insane background sections which bothered me tremendously and this change cleans up all of that mess as well.  The ultimate goal is to support configuration of multiple ecosystems, but we've got other ground to cover first so that feature will have to wait for a bit.  The `Labfile` should reside in the root of your `chef-repo`.

Here is a sample of what a `Labfile` might look like:

    #!/usr/bin/env ruby
    #^syntax detection

    ecosystem "mockup-app-1" do

      container "nginx-lb-test-1" do # or apache-lb-test-1
        distro "ubuntu"
        release "lucid"
        persist true
        ip "192.168.32.100"
        mac "00:00:5e:d1:fa:08"
        chef_client  ({ :environment => "test",
                        :run_list => [
                          "role[base]",
                          "role[nginx_lb_server]"
                        ]
                      })
      end

      container "nginx-unicorn-test-1" do # or apache-passenger-test-1
        distro "ubuntu"
        release "lucid"
        persist true
        ip "192.168.32.200"
        mac "00:00:5e:eb:8d:d3"
        chef_client  ({ :environment => "test",
                        :run_list => [
                          "role[base]",
                          "role[nginx_unicorn_server]"
                        ]
                      })
      end

      container "redis-test-1" do
        distro "ubuntu"
        release "lucid"
        persist true
        ip "192.168.32.210"
        mac "00:00:5e:eb:8d:a3"
        chef_client  ({ :environment => "test",
                        :run_list => [
                          "role[base]",
                          "role[redis_server]"
                        ]
                      })
      end

      container "mysql-test-1" do
        distro "ubuntu"
        release "lucid"
        persist true
        ip "192.168.32.220"
        mac "00:00:5e:ea:fe:28"
        chef_client  ({ :environment => "test",
                        :run_list => [
                          "role[base]",
                          "role[mysql_server]"
                        ]
                      })
      end

    end
